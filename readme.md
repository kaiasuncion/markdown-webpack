By doing this exercise, I have learned the following:
- How frameworks can start as a boilerplate and as the project grows over time for efficiency and convenience during development can evolve 
- Why frameworks are reliant on bundlers like webpack 
- How local markdown can be used as pseudo cms 
- How cmss make managing content easier 
- The some of the core functionality difference between git based cms and api based cms for static generation. 
- Routing for frameworks doesn't create html pages, but shows and hides javascript intuitively within the browser/client side
